Dragon Tale Platformer Game


Starting with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzhgsVaiSo I was able to understand how to lay out the basic foundation 
of the game.  After I had the foundation down, I started to play around with different ideas I could add to the game. I 
had a great time adding additional levels, bosses, power-ups, monsters, and mechanics.  Figuring out how to translate 
my ideas into working code was an interesting experience to say the least.
